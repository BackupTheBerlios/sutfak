Sutfak : A Lojban quick dictionary

Sutfak is a program that acts like a localized, handy version of Jbovlaste, the online
Lojban dictionary. Features include:

- Searches for English gloss words, text within definitions, and for gismu, cmavo, and rafsi
- Allows P5 regular expression searches within definitions
- Shows a log of all searches performed
- De-constructs lujvo into their component rafsi
- Searches for multiple terms at a time (separated by commas)

Note that Sutfak is not a validator: it may return output even for ungrammatical lujvo.
