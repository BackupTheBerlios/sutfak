Sutfak : A Lojban quick dictionary

Sutfak is a Perl5/Tk program that acts a bit like a localized, handy version of
Jbovlaste, the online Lojban dictionary at http://www.lojban.org/jbovlaste/.

Usage:
Use the "Word" button to search for English gloss words, gismu, cmavo, and rafsi, and
to decompose lujvo. Use the "Def" button to find gismu and cmavo whose definitions
match a Perl 5 regular expression. Use the "Selma'o" button to find all the other
cmavo in a given cmavo's selma'o, or to find all the cmavo in a given selma'o. You
can make multiple searches at once by inserting commas between search terms.

Note that Sutfak isn't a validator; it may return output even for badly formed lujvo.
